# Vision-based docking for Omnidirectional Wheeled Mobile Robot
For this project, I designed and implemented a docking system via the Robot Operating System (ROS) that not only would enable the robot to dock at the charge station, but also would load and carry interchangeable carts and racks. This is one of the main projects I worked on at Gyro Systems.
